# loan_approval_project_4

# Project Overview

## Topic: Loan Prediction

### Dataset: [Loan Prediction Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vivekmuraleedharan/loan-prediction/input)

### Breakdown:

For our project, we will use Machine Learning with various techniques to predict whether a candidate's profile is relevant using key features like Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc. Our team's goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a person will get his/her loan approved.
Some possible factors that can affect the outcome, i.e., which of the features will have an impact on whether a loan will be approved or not, are as follows: 
- **Education:** Applicants with a higher education level, i.e. graduate level, should have higher chances of loan approval
- **Income/Incomes:** Applicants with higher income should have more chances of loan approval
- **Loan amount:** If the loan amount is less, the chances of loan approval should be high

# Data Model Implementation

This project aims to implement a Python script that initializes, trains, and evaluates a machine learning model. The following requirements must be met:

- **Model Initialization, Training, and Evaluation (10 points):** The Python script should effectively initialize, train, and evaluate the model.
  
- **Data Preprocessing (5 points):** Prior to modeling, the data should undergo cleaning, normalization, and standardization processes to ensure its quality and consistency.

- **Data Retrieval (5 points):** The model should utilize data retrieved either from SQL databases or Spark for training and evaluation.

- **Model Performance (5 points):** The model should demonstrate meaningful predictive power, achieving at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.

# Data Model Optimization

In addition to model implementation, optimization is crucial for enhancing performance. The following requirements should be fulfilled:

- **Optimization Process Documentation (15 points):** Document the iterative changes made to the model and their impact on model performance. This documentation can be presented in a CSV/Excel table or within the Python script itself.

- **Performance Reporting (10 points):** The overall model performance, including any optimizations, should be printed or displayed at the end of the script.

# GitHub Documentation

Maintaining clear documentation on GitHub is essential for collaboration and transparency. The following criteria should be met:

- **Repository Organization (10 points):** The GitHub repository should be free of unnecessary files and folders, with an appropriate .gitignore file in use to manage dependencies and artifacts.

- **README Presentation (15 points):** The README should serve as a polished presentation of the project's content, providing comprehensive information on its objectives, implementation, and outcomes.

# Group Presentation

A successful group presentation is integral to conveying the project's significance and accomplishments. Ensure the following aspects are addressed:

- **Participation (5 points):** All group members should actively contribute to the presentation, with each member speaking during the session.

- **Content Quality (10 points):** The presentation should feature well-structured content, smooth transitions, and clear conclusions within any time restrictions.

- **Relevance (10 points):** The content presented should directly relate to the project, covering its objectives, methodologies, results, and implications.

- **Engagement (5 points):** Maintain audience interest throughout the presentation by delivering engaging and informative content.

# Grading Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on the fulfillment of the above requirements and will be assigned a grade according to the following table:

| Grade | Points |
|-------|--------|
| A (+/-) | 90+ |
| B (+/-) | 80–89 |
| C (+/-) | 70–79 |
| D (+/-) | 60–69 |
| F (+/-) | < 60 |

# Submission

To submit the project, provide the URL of your GitHub repository for grading. Ensure that the repository contains all necessary files and documentation required for evaluation.

**Note:** Projects are mandatory for graduation, and missing more than two Challenge assignments will result in disqualification.
