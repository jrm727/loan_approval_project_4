# Project Overview

## Topic: Loan Prediction

### Dataset: [Loan Prediction Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vivekmuraleedharan/loan-prediction/input)

### Breakdown:

In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed.
Banks tend to focus on your income and how you make it, the property you are buying and its value, your savings and spending habits, your credit history, and what you own or owe. [Source](https://lifesherpa.com.au/articles/top-9-things-banks-look-for-when-approving-home-loans)

For our project, we will use Machine Learning with various techniques to predict whether a candidate's profile is relevant using key features like Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc. Our team's goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a person will get his/her loan approved.
Some possible factors that can affect the outcome, i.e., which of the features will have an impact on whether a loan will be approved or not, are as follows: 
- **Education:** Applicants with a higher education level, i.e. graduate level, should have higher chances of loan approval
- **Income/Incomes:** Applicants with higher income should have more chances of loan approval
- **Loan amount:** If the loan amount is less, the chances of loan approval should be high

# Data Model Implementation

This project aims to implement a Python script that initializes, trains, and evaluates a machine learning model. The following requirements must be met:

- **Model Initialization, Training, and Evaluation (10 points):** The Python script should effectively initialize, train, and evaluate the model.
  
- **Data Preprocessing (5 points):** Prior to modeling, the data should undergo cleaning, normalization, and standardization processes to ensure its quality and consistency.

- **Data Retrieval (5 points):** The model should utilize data retrieved either from SQL databases or Spark for training and evaluation.

- **Model Performance (5 points):** The model should demonstrate meaningful predictive power, achieving at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.

# Data Model Optimization

In addition to model implementation, optimization is crucial for enhancing performance. The following requirements should be fulfilled:

- **Optimization Process Documentation (15 points):** Document the iterative changes made to the model and their impact on model performance. This documentation can be presented in a CSV/Excel table or within the Python script itself.

- **Performance Reporting (10 points):** The overall model performance, including any optimizations, should be printed or displayed at the end of the script.

# GitHub Documentation

Maintaining clear documentation on GitHub is essential for collaboration and transparency. The following criteria should be met:

- **Repository Organization (10 points):** The GitHub repository should be free of unnecessary files and folders, with an appropriate .gitignore file in use to manage dependencies and artifacts.

- **README Presentation (15 points):** The README should serve as a polished presentation of the project's content, providing comprehensive information on its objectives, implementation, and outcomes.

# Group Presentation

A successful group presentation is integral to conveying the project's significance and accomplishments. Ensure the following aspects are addressed:

- **Participation (5 points):** All group members should actively contribute to the presentation, with each member speaking during the session.

- **Content Quality (10 points):** The presentation should feature well-structured content, smooth transitions, and clear conclusions within any time restrictions.

- **Relevance (10 points):** The content presented should directly relate to the project, covering its objectives, methodologies, results, and implications.

- **Engagement (5 points):** Maintain audience interest throughout the presentation by delivering engaging and informative content.

# Grading Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on the fulfillment of the above requirements and will be assigned a grade according to the following table:

| Grade | Points |
|-------|--------|
| A (+/-) | 90+ |
| B (+/-) | 80–89 |
| C (+/-) | 70–79 |
| D (+/-) | 60–69 |
| F (+/-) | < 60 |

# Submission

To submit the project, provide the URL of your GitHub repository for grading. Ensure that the repository contains all necessary files and documentation required for evaluation.

**Note:** Projects are mandatory for graduation, and missing more than two Challenge assignments will result in disqualification.
